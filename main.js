    correctText: "Antibiotics target bacterial cell structures absent in viruses",
    feedback: "Antibiotics work by targeting specific structures found only in bacteria — like cell walls, ribosomes, or DNA replication enzymes. Since viruses lack these structures entirely, antibiotics have no mechanism to act on them."

    correctText: "Short-wavelength blue light scatters more than longer wavelengths in the atmosphere",
    feedback: "Rayleigh scattering causes shorter (blue) wavelengths of sunlight to scatter in all directions far more than longer (red/yellow) wavelengths. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from every direction in the sky."

    correctText: "DNA stores genetic instructions that guide the synthesis of proteins via RNA",

    correctText: "The tilt of Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane",
    feedback: "Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5°. Different hemispheres receive more direct sunlight at different points in the orbit, creating summer and winter. Earth is actually slightly closer to the Sun during the Northern Hemisphere's winter."

    correctText: "How many dentists were surveyed and what exactly were they asked?",

    correctText: "The theory can potentially be disproven by an experiment or observation",

    correctText: "To confirm results are reliable and not due to chance, fraud, or lab-specific errors",

    correctText: "A theory has been repeatedly tested and supported by substantial evidence; a hypothesis is an initial testable prediction",

    correctText: "2 in 100,000 — still extremely low",
    feedback: "Relative risk ('doubles the risk') sounds alarming but must be paired with absolute risk. Going from 1 to 2 in 100,000 is a 100% relative increase but only a 0.001% absolute increase. Always consider both when making medical decisions."

    correctText: "Exactly 50% — each flip is independent",
    feedback: "This is the gambler's fallacy. A fair coin has no memory. Each flip is an independent event with a 50% probability regardless of past outcomes. The streak is surprising but does not change the physics of the next flip."

    correctText: "If the null hypothesis were true, there is a 3% chance of seeing a result this extreme",
    feedback: "A p-value does not measure the probability that your hypothesis is true. It measures how surprising your data would be if there were no real effect. A small p-value suggests the data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis — but says nothing about practical importance."

    correctText: "It improved by 5 percentage points (absolute) and 50% relatively — both are valid descriptions",
    feedback: "Absolute improvement: 5 percentage points. Relative improvement: failures dropped from 10% to 5% — a 50% reduction. Both are mathematically correct. Context determines which framing is most informative."

    correctText: "The second poll — larger sample gives a narrower margin of error",
    feedback: "With n=50 the margin of error is roughly ±14%; with n=5,000 it narrows to about ±1.4%. The second poll's 55% estimate is far more precise and reliable even though the percentage is slightly lower."
